Setting Up

	-Run setup.bat to install django and cefpython3

	-After successful installation you can delete setup.bat and setup_requirements.txt

	-The app folder is a sample django project which you can delete

	-Paste your Django project folder where app folder is placed(it is recommended to compile all .py files to .pyc and delete all .py files, this will protect your source code.If you don't django2exe will compile all .py to .pyc but won't delete your .py files)

	-In the config folder paste the icon you want on the application window

	-Edit the config.json to get it all running

		-project_dir_name -> Name of your django projec folder

		Rest all settings are self-explanatory

	-Install all your pip requirements and migrations using the terminal which can be launched by executing py-dist\scripts\cmd.bat

	-When all done, try launching the your application with launch.bat
